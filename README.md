## Globally-local-variable-importance-algoritm-in-python
- Two methods to calculate local variable importance with global models.
. For several months working on this issue, I finally proposed two methods and realised them in python. Hopefully, I upload the codes to get some contribution from developers all over the world. Simutaneously, we wish to obtain some suggestions.
If you have questions or suggestios, please connect to the only auther Tao Li, Sichuan Univercity, China with the email:lp1559345469@gmail.com.
